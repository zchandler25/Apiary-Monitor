  collab to start connecting components, things of note:
        build main loop to query sensors for temp and humidity.
        build tester.py to test communication to influxdb cloud.
        pi pico is unable to support standart influxdb lib, using urequests to accomidate minmal specs of hardware.
        
        Issues:
         Influxdb will take data, but is not consistent with storing and displaying. will require more troubleshooting.
         pico hardware was difficult in reflashing.
         due to hardware low specs, currnetly only running main funciton to meeasure and send sensor data. will need to troubleshoot device capability to
        support screen with button on/timed off, blinking led (power indicator) 
        
        Remaining work:
        3 more picos will need to be flashed, soldered, tested.
        create a dashboard that can displayh each pico as a unique data sorce in the same graph (need to compare)


        Future/what ifs
        Auto notifications based on temp/humidity thresshold.
