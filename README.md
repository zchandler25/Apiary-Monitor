# Apiary-Monitor

Honey bees are essential to the health of our ecosystem. as a hobby, I own 4 Honey bee hives in my backyard.

As a beekeeper i wanted to enable the remote monitoring of my hives. Knowing the temperatrue, humidty levels and weight are critical data points that point to the health of a colony.
